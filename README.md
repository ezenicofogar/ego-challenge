## How to run the project

### 1. Dependencies

You need a Python environment with `Django 5.0.3` and `Django REST Framework 3.14` installed.
I use `pipenv`, a tool that manages this.

If you have `pipenv` installed (only available on Linux) navigate to the repository folder and run the next commands:

> \$ `pipenv update`\
> \$ `pipenv shell`

This will create the virtual environment with the dependencies installed.

If you don't want (or can't) to use `pipenv`, the `requirements.txt` file sould help you set up the project using another tool.

### 2. Running the server

Once you set up the dependencies, just run the command:

> \$ `python ./project/manage.py runserver`

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080/

## My development environment

- Python Virtual Env.: `pipenv`
- Python Dependencies: `pipenv`
- Editor: `Visual Studio Code`
- O.S.: `Manjaro Linux (arch)`
